        <h2>Junior at Bob Jones from Iowa</h2>
        
         <p>Hiya! Nice to meet you! I'm Sarah, known to some as Turtle. I'm a Junior Biblical counseling major with a women's ministry concentration at Bob Jones University.</p>
         <p>
           I work at Cuppa Jones in the Den, and occasionally at Cuppa Jones Express by Mack Library. I love working at Cuppa! I get to know a whole bunch of people and learn their orders. On top of getting to know so many cool people, I also get to do latte art! I've worked in coffee for 4 years, so I've practiced latte art just for a fun for a few years now, and I try to make each latte a piece of art. So next time you get a latte, check and see if I made a bit of art for you!</p> 
         <p>
            I go to Gethsemane Baptist Church in Greenville, where I get to help run the youth group. I usually come up with the games for the night, and we've been known to do some pretty crazy things! (eg. Noodle Polo, Amoeba, and Cat in the Hat!) You're always welcome to join and participate in the games and hear some great preaching from the Bible!

            In my spare time (HA!) I like to read, draw, cook, spend way too much time on Twitter, and video chat with my friends. ^-^
